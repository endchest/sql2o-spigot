## How to create your JDBI database

Here is example of your mysql database:

```java
import me.hteppl.data.database.MySQLDatabase;

public class MyDatabase extends MySQLDatabase {

    public MyDatabase() {
        super("host", "database", "user", "password");
        // also you can execute your db scheme with 
        // this.executeScheme("scheme");
    }
}
```

or sqlite database:

```java
import me.hteppl.data.database.SQLiteDatabase;

public class MyDatabase extends SQLiteDatabase {

    public MyDatabase() {
        super("database");
        // also you can execute your db scheme with 
        // this.executeScheme("scheme");
    }
}
```
